Basic Steps/Guide To Become a Software Developer:

1. Your end goal
	-* Data Science: something related to it
	- Backend Development

2. Choose a programming language
	- Learn Fundamentals FIRST! Really important.
	- Python: also learn HTML and CSS, just need to learn the basics on these two.
	- Also need to learn other programming language (think of this as secondary/nice to learn) like R, SQL
	- Save frameworks, etc for later (should be based on your main programming language)

3. Find resources and build a curriculum*
	- Don't need to follow a curriculum but it's nice to have.
	- Video courses mostly from YouTube but don't follow too many, just a couple of channels is enough.
	- Look on resource/documentation for reference, you don't have to go all through it.
	- Challenge websites: leetcode, geeksforgeeks, codewars

4. Find a community
	- Not necessary but meet someone that is completely new through online community or tech/programming meetups

5. Create your own projects
	- Following a course or just learning/reading concepts is ONLY half the battle.
	- Your projects does NOT have to be from scatch. This is true when you're just starting.
	- On your projects, ADD new features. Use documentations as a supplement to figure new things out on your own.
	- Look into other people's code that is similar to what you want to achieve as a reference ONLY.
	- You won't need to use other projects as a starting point later eventually.

6. Create your portfolio
	- Any projects you did on your own!
	- Showcase a live version (through your own website) and your source code.
	- Self taught developers NEED a great portfolio with work(?)/your own examples.

7. Contribute to open source
	- Try to offer to make something for someone or any small company/community like a random small business or a person (I hope thos makes sense).
	- Learn to use GitHub!

8. Create an online presence
	- Upload all of your work on Github and keep it well documented for easy view and access to anyone especially to employers.
	- You could also showcase it on your own website.

9. Prepare & Apply to jobs
	- All other boxes should be chacked
	- Prepare for interviews, practice algorithms, create a resume, cover letter, etc.
	- Search for jobs in your area that are looking for things you know.
	- Apply even if it says degree required***
	- Remember... it is your FIRST job, not your last.
